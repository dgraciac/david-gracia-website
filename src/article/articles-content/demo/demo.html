<p>As a <strong>seasoned</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security" title="Computer Security">cybersecurity</a> <em>leader</em> with years of experience navigating the ever-evolving landscape of digital
threats and technological advancements, I've come to realize that one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal is not a
piece of software or a fancy gadget—it's our mindset. In particular, cultivating a growth mindset has the potential to
propel individuals to new heights in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security" title="Computer Security">cybersecurity</a> careers, empowering them to tackle challenges with resilience,
innovation, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you really are just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.</p>

<h2>Paragraphs</h2>

<p>In cybersecurity, change is the only constant. New technologies, evolving attack vectors, and shifting regulatory
landscapes demand that professionals remain adaptable and open to learning. A growth mindset enables individuals to
embrace change as an opportunity for growth rather than a setback. Instead of becoming discouraged by unfamiliar
challenges, those with a growth mindset approach them with curiosity and a willingness to learn. This adaptability is
crucial in an industry where the only certainty is uncertainty.</p>

<p>This is a quotation block:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth2.0</a> is a <strong>security standard</strong> that is used in many <em>applications</em> these days. One will find two predominant perspectives
  of this standard: the one that the client experiences and the other that the developer experiences. This blog aims to
  bring these two perspectives to <code>you</code> in the form of a story, and along the way you will learn how it works, the most
  commonly used flow — the authentication flow, how you can use it as a developer and so on…</p>
