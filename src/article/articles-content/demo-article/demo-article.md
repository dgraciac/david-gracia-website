## Paragraphs and CTA

In cybersecurity, change is the only constant. New technologies, evolving attack vectors, and shifting regulatory
landscapes demand that professionals remain adaptable and open to learning. A growth mindset enables individuals to
embrace change as an opportunity for growth rather than a setback. Instead of becoming discouraged by unfamiliar
challenges, those with a growth mindset approach them with curiosity and a willingness to learn. This adaptability is
crucial in an industry where the only certainty is uncertainty.

## Quotation blocks

This is a quotation block:

> [OAuth2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) is a **security standard** that is used in many _applications_ these days. One will find two predominant perspectives
> of this standard: the one that the client experiences and the other that the developer experiences. This blog aims to
> bring these two perspectives to `you` in the form of a story, and along the way you will learn how it works, the most
> commonly used flow — the authentication flow, how you can use it as a developer and so on…

The purpose of this paragraph is to see the space between a quotation and the next element.

Quotation blocks can include any other element and style as shown below:
